James' ashamed self
More posts!
This is mainly to hide the typo that I'm pretty ashamed about, and I can't fix it so yeah
It's probably pretty easy to guess where I made the mistake because importantly I have no way of fixing it but yeah anyway I don't even know why I'm writing this because why should I bring attention to it?

Maybe
Just maybe
It's to test out how good really longgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg posts are formatted

Now you see, ^^^^^^ that right there is a problem that I really don't want to fix because there really is no reason to fix it: there are no words that belong here that will be like 1000 characters long (unless you bust out some compound like <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061113221628AAxlNn5" target="_blank">titin</a>.
