Eric is a junior at TJHSST and is an avid STEM enthusiast. He has conducted some microbiome research related to cancer development, diet, and geography and is excited to present some of his work at the Science Fair with his partner. He is looking forward to continuing research in the Biotechnology Senior Research Laboratory next year. Eric is also passionate about community service and tutoring, and is a STEMbassador, Writing Center Tutor, and Latin Honor Society Tutor. STEM and Humanities go hand-in-hand, and Cancer Research Society was founded to not only kindle passion and collaboration in STEM research, but also explore the selflessness in science.

A junior at TJ, Vikram is passionate about genomics, specifically in conducting research on how cancer is connected to the genome, exome, and transcriptome of a cell. He has been fortunate to conduct genomics research at the Smithsonian Institute, studying botanical phylogenetics by sequencing, assembling, and analyzing chloroplast genomes for evolutionary divergence among plant species. He looks forward to further applying genomics in a variety of biological disciplines, and spreading his interests to the community, as well as spread cancer research awareness and uphold the mission of CRS!
