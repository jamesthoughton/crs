Eric is a junior at TJHSST and is an avid STEM enthusiast. He has conducted some microbiome research related to cancer development, diet, and geography and is excited to present some of his work at the Science Fair with his partner. He is looking forward to continuing research in the Biotechnology Senior Research Laboratory next year. Eric is also passionate about community service and tutoring, and is a STEMbassador, Writing Center Tutor, and Latin Honor Society Tutor. STEM and Humanities go hand-in-hand, and Cancer Research Society was founded to not only kindle passion and collaboration in STEM research, but also explore the selflessness in science.
